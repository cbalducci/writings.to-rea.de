    <h1>CAPSULE 2: The Coaching Habit</h1>
<h6>In the Capsule blog series you will find the core idea, takeaways and a summary of interesting books I read.</h6>
<p><strong>Read it because: it will help you to transform any conversation in a coaching opportunity</strong></p>
<h2>Core idea</h2>
<p>Coaching is often considered as something that happens in a specific setting, inside a formal coach/client relationship. "The Coaching Habit" turns this concept on its head and says that, with the right questions, any conversation can become a coaching conversation. This is looked at through the lenses of workplace coaching.</p>
<p>As the title says, it aims to get the reader to develop an habit of coaching and to give them a minimal starting tool-kit of useful questions.</p>
<p><strong>My key takeaway</strong>: when having a coaching conversation, leaving the client time to reflect on the problem is extremely important. Asking questions like "And what else?" and letting the silence build up is a great way of stimulating thought. </p>
<h3>Scorecard</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: 5 / 5 (0 reads like a dictionary, 5 reads like a good novel)</li>
<li><strong>density</strong>: 3 / 5 (0 a book that should have been a blog, 5 good words to concepts ratio)</li>
<li><strong>focus</strong>: 5 / 5 (0 tries to explain life, the universe and everything, 5 keeps it tight on the topic)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breakdown</h2>
<h3>The Kickstart Question</h3>
<p>"What's on your mind?"</p>
<p>In this part the book introduces an open question useful to start coaching conversations. It then goes on describing the 3 Ps model (project, people, patterns), useful to better understand the subject of the conversation.</p>
<h3>The AWE Question</h3>
<p>"And what else?"</p>
<p>Here the subject of broadening understanding is approached again, with specific attention at using silence. This part also touches on how to avoid to go in "solution mode" and start to give advices to the client.</p>
<h3>The Focus Question</h3>
<p>"What is the real challenge here for you?"</p>
<p>This chapter gives useful insight on how to zero in on the most impactfull challenge to solve. Part of the insight is an interesting excursus on detecting when coaching conversations are going off track.</p>
<h3>The Foundation Question</h3>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>The so called Foundation Question is used in the book as a device to separate needs from wants. The aim is to make explicit what the objective is by eliciting self reflection.</p>
<h3>The Lazy Question</h3>
<p>"How can I help?"</p>
<p>When we try to help someone, often we end up helping them by doing what we <em>think</em> they want us to do. Why not ask it directly? This is the subject of this chapter, contextualised by a clear explanation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle">Karpman Drama Triangle</a>.</p>
<h3>The Strategic Question</h3>
<p>"If you are saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?"</p>
<p>As stated before, this book looks at coaching in the workplace. This question introduces the topic of managing capacity and achieving time/impact balance. It goes on to talk about project boundaries and how a "yes" needs to be delimited by some "noes".</p>
<h3>The Learning Question</h3>
<p>"What was more useful for you?"</p>
<p>The closing chapters describe this closing question, aimed at helping the client crystallise the key insights they gained in the coaching conversation. This core concept is used to put in context good advice on feedback, learning and reinforcing loops.</p>
