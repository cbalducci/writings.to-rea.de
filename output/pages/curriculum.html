<p>While in this position, I have helped the team achieve an high level of agile maturity and of organisational resiliancy.</p>
<p>As a stretch responsibility, I have lead an additional business critical initiative. This was a completely different work stream from my current team delivery and involved assembling a cross functional team (spanning engineering, finance and legal), scoping the problem, identifying a solution, implementing it and managing C-level stakeholders expectations.</p>
