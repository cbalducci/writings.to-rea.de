&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read it because: it gives you a great toolbox to start coaching.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Core idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book describes a coaching framework based on active listening and effective communication. It puts it in context with plenty of examples and does a great job at keeping clarity of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My key takeaway&lt;/strong&gt;: directive approaches (E.G. proposing an option for consideration by the client) have a place in the coaching toolbox. They also have their caveats and need to be used with great attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scorecard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;readability&lt;/strong&gt;: 4 / 5 (0 reads like a dictionary, 5 reads like a good novel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;density&lt;/strong&gt;: 5 / 5 (0 a book that should have been a blog, 5 good words to concepts ratio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt;: 4 / 5 (0 tries to explain life, the universe and everything, 5 keeps it tight on the topic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part I - Effective coaching defined&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part the core concepts of the book are introduced, establishing the terminology and some foundation that will be referred to in the following chapters. Concepts like focus/interference interaction and the ladder of non-directive/directive coaching techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part II - The models and skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GROW model, the T-model (expand and focus), non directive techniques and a chapter on "Proposing". This part of the book is the one about explaining the toolbox, building on the concepts from Part I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part III - Coaching in the workplace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Part III coaching is analysed in the context of the workplace, looking at it from different sides. Internally, on the relationship with leadership when coaching leaders or when coaching as a leader. Externally, when working as a business coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially interesting the chapter on "Coaching teams", where the author uses a different model from the more common "Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part IV - Coaching and genius&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these final chapters the book takes a more philosophical approach on coaching and unlocking human potential. It includes an interesting piece on finding your own coaching style.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
