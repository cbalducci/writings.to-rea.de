Hello, I'm Cristiano and I write stuff!
Here I mainly write about management, coaching, leadership, agile and team
dynamics.

If you are looking to hire a software engineering manager you might want
to take a look at [my CV][curriculum] or maybe just drop
me an [email](mailto:cristiano.balducci@gmail.com).

On the internet, you can also find me on
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristianobalducci/) or
[medium](https://medium.com/@cbldc). You can also find me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/cbldc_) but I am not terribly active there.
