## Experience

### Engineering Manager @ SkyScanner
_10/2018 - present_

Squad Lead for a backend engineering team.
Responsibilities of this role are to challenge and lead a team of 8 engineers, supporting them in delivering resilient software solutions at scale. On top of that, I am responsible of managing the road map, supported by a Product Owner, and of supporting the members of the team on their career development.

While in this position, I have helped the team achieve an high level of agile maturity and of organisational resiliancy.

As a stretch responsibility, I have lead an additional business critical initiative. This was a completely different work stream from my current team delivery and involved assembling a cross functional team (spanning engineering, finance and legal), scoping the problem, identifying a solution, implementing it and managing C-level stakeholders expectations.

### Engineering Manager @ NCR
_12/2017 - 10/2018_

Line manager for the Engineering Operations team.
In this position i was responsible for the team's well being and deliverables, while also acting as technical lead and Kanban coach.

The most notable project was the implementation of an updated Continuous Integration pipeline that will enable the organisation to reach higher levels of agility and software quality.

Scrum Master and Technical Lead for the Engineering Operations team with a focus on Big Data technologies.
In this role I acted as team coordinator applying agile methodologies to our work-flow, moving from scrum to Kanban.

My most notable achievement in this role was the acquisition of a considerable know how on the Big Data infrastructure in a really short amount of time. This knowledge enabled the Big Data team to achieve new level of stability in their platform.

Another important contribution was the creation of an **automation tool** that allowed the rest of the team
to manage Big Data cluster configurations as simple yaml files and store it under version control.
