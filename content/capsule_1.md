###### In the Capsule blog series you will find the core idea, takeaways and a summary of interesting books I read.
**Read it because: it gives you a great toolbox to start coaching.**

## Core idea
This book describes a coaching framework based on active listening and effective communication. It puts it in context with plenty of examples and does a great job at keeping clarity of purpose.

**My key takeaway**: directive approaches (E.G. proposing an option for consideration by the client) have a place in the coaching toolbox. They also have their caveats and need to be used with great attention. 

### Scorecard
* **readability**: 4 / 5 (0 reads like a dictionary, 5 reads like a good novel)
* **density**: 5 / 5 (0 a book that should have been a blog, 5 good words to concepts ratio)
* **focus**: 4 / 5 (0 tries to explain life, the universe and everything, 5 keeps it tight on the topic)

## Breakdown
### Part I - Effective coaching defined
In this part the core concepts of the book are introduced, establishing the terminology and some foundation that will be referred to in the following chapters. Concepts like focus/interference interaction and the ladder of non-directive/directive coaching techniques.

### Part II - The models and skills
The GROW model, the T-model (expand and focus), non directive techniques and a chapter on "Proposing". This part of the book is the one about explaining the toolbox, building on the concepts from Part I.

### Part III - Coaching in the workplace
In Part III coaching is analysed in the context of the workplace, looking at it from different sides. Internally, on the relationship with leadership when coaching leaders or when coaching as a leader. Externally, when working as a business coach. 

Especially interesting the chapter on "Coaching teams", where the author uses a different model from the more common "Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing".

### Part IV - Coaching and genius 
In these final chapters the book takes a more philosophical approach on coaching and unlocking human potential. It includes an interesting piece on finding your own coaching style.
