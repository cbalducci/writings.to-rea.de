    <h6>In the Capsule blog series you will find the core idea, takeaways and a summary of interesting books I read.</h6>
<h2>Core idea</h2>
<p>This book describes a coaching framework based on active listening and effective communication. It puts it in context with plenty of examples and does a great job at keeping clarity of purpose.</p>
<p><strong>My key takeaway</strong>: directive approaches (E.G. proposing an option for consideration by the client) have a place in the coaching toolbox. They also have their caveats and need to be used with great attention.</p>
<h3>Scorecard</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: 4 / 5 (0 reads like a dictionary, 5 reads like a good novel)</li>
<li><strong>density</strong>: 5 / 5 (0 a book that should have been a blog, 5 good words to concepts ratio)</li>
<li><strong>focus</strong>: 4 / 5 (0 tries to explain life, the universe and everything, 5 keeps it tight on the topic)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breakdown</h2>
<h3>Part I - Effective coaching defined</h3>
<p>In this part the core concepts of the book are introduced, establishing the terminology and some foundation that will be referred to in the following chapters. Concepts like focus/interference interaction and the ladder of non-directive/directive coaching techniques.</p>
<h3>Part II - The models and skills</h3>
<p>The GROW model, the T-model (expand and focus), non directive techniques and a chapter on "Proposing". This part of the book is the one about explaining the toolbox, building on the concepts from Part I.</p>
<h3>Part III - Coaching in the workplace</h3>
<p>In Part III coaching is analysed in the context of the workplace, looking at it from different sides. Internally, on the relationship with leadership when coaching leaders or when coaching as a leader. Externally, when working as a business coach.</p>
<p>Especially interesting the chapter on "Coaching teams", where the author uses a different model from the more common "Forming-Storming-Norming-Performing".</p>
<h3>Part IV - Coaching and genius</h3>
<p>In these final chapters the book takes a more philosophical approach on coaching and unlocking human potential. It includes an interesting piece on finding your own coaching style.</p>
